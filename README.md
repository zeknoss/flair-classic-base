# Wooden Base Project for the Flair Espresso Classic
This is an open-source wooden platform project for those who love and use Flair Espresso Classic.

You can use the models in this repository to carve a wooden platform with the desired cavities and make yourself a nice, cozy, practical platform.

Feel free to contribute to the project. I've put all the resources I used in my own project.
