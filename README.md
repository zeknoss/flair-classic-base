# Wooden Base Project for the Flair Espresso Classic
This is an open-source wooden platform project for those who love and use Flair Espresso Classic.

You can use the models in this repository to carve a wooden platform with the desired cavities and make yourself a nice, cozy, practical platform.

Feel free to contribute to the project. I've put all the resources I used in my own project.

## How to Use The Files
I measured Flair Classic base and the scale I used to create SVG files, then converted them into pdf to import into ArtCam software.
You can use any CAM suite to import the files and configure your CNC machine to use however depth you want.

In my case, the CNC machine had a 6mm carver head and we configured the machine to the following depths:

- Classic Base Cavity: 8mm in depth from the surface of the wood block
- Scale Cavity: 22mm in depth from the Classic Base cavity (30mm in depth from the surface of the wood block)

If you can open the .art file, you can find the other ports for the tools including:
- Tamper
- Brew head
- Portafilter
- Pressure gauge
- Dosing cone
- Brew head heating cap I made out of 60mm 303 stainless steel bar in a lathe machine

## Note
This project is open-source and only for personal use. Please DO NOT use this project for commercial use as it will betray the whole idea of open-sourcing it in the first place.
